        I enjoy building robust software and powerful substrates—the abstracted layers of intelligent machines. Most of my work is in pioneering robotic systems, spaceflight, and physics-based computing.
        I'm currently in the BSc Data Science track at Simon Fraser University, where I'm studying computer science and mathematics.
